Vision
Our vision is to create an app that allows users to create custom flows for processes they use in their work.
Background
As companies go through the digitalization process, they need to move their process to apps that can help them automate and optimize their work. 

It is important for stakeholders to create flows needed for their own processes and be able to create new ones easily. 

At the same time it is important to see analytics about their processes to see how they can adapt them.

Companies like UiPath, IBM, Oracle have invested in tools to create processes.
Goal
Create a process builder that can help users make their own flows.
